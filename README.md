The TamperMonkey VPN Hyperlink script is a powerful tool designed to improve the browsing experience by seamlessly transforming IP-based hyperlinks into their corresponding domain-based counterparts. It operates as a Tampermonkey script, integrating with popular web browsers and enabling users to effortlessly navigate between web pages without encountering inconveniences caused by IP addresses. By replacing IP addresses with domain names in hyperlinks, the script ensures a smoother transition and reduces the cognitive load associated with manual IP interpretation.

The script analyzes web pages for hyperlinks containing IP addresses and dynamically modifies them on the fly. Whenever a user clicks on a hyperlink, the script captures the event and evaluates the target URL. If the URL contains an IP address, such as '192.168.1.5', the script seamlessly converts it to the base domain of the current page. This conversion process facilitates a consistent browsing experience by aligning all hyperlinks to the same domain format, eliminating the need for users to mentally interpret IP addresses and minimizing the risk of incorrect inputs.
